Meesho Data Analyst Interview Questions (0–3 Yrs)

Here are some SQL questions they asked:

1️⃣ How would you optimize a slow query with multiple joins?
Use Indexes in joins
2️⃣ What is a recursive CTE, and when would you use it?
CET: Common Table Expression
ex to count upto 3: [with countup as (select 1 as n  union all select n+1 from countup where n<3) select * from countup ]
exp: recursive with executes Base query (select 1 as n) first and then keeps executing recursive query (WITHOUT PROCESSING SAME INPUT TWICE) till it returns empty set
use: Ancestory Search
3️⃣ Difference between clustered and non-clustered indexes.
4️⃣ Write a query to find the second highest salary in each department.
select dep, salary from
(select dep, salary, dense_rank() over (partition by dep order by salary) as row
	from
 employee_data)
where row =2
5️⃣ How do you detect and resolve deadlocks in SQL?
6️⃣ Explain ROW_NUMBER, RANK, and DENSE_RANK with examples.
ROW_NUMBER: In case of two thing having same sort value it randomly assigns x, x+1 ranks to them thus avoiding duplicate ranks
RANK: Assigns same rank for same sort value thus having duplicate ranks and skips all the subsequent ranks  
DENSE_RANK: Assigns same rank for a tie but does not skip next ranls
7️⃣ What are ACID properties, and why are they important?
They are a set of four property that ensures Database transactions are reliable. They are Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation and Durability.
Importance for critical operations, say payment transactions.
8️⃣ Write a query to calculate a running total with conditions.

Focus on SQL basics, optimization techniques, and advanced concepts like window functions and indexing.
